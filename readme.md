# Message Encryption and Decryption

This Python application provides a simple GUI for message encryption and decryption using the Vigenère cipher. It allows you to securely protect your messages by encrypting them with a key, and then decrypting them with the same key.

## Features

- Message encryption with a key.
- Message decryption with the same key.
- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Secure Vigenère cipher implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.6+)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

     `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/message-encryption-decryption.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

     `cd message-encryption-decryption`

3. Install the required packages (Tkinter should be pre-installed with Python):

     `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the application 

     `python main.py`

2. Enter your name, message, key, and choose the mode (encrypt or decrypt).

3. Click the "Show Message" button to perform the selected action.

4. The result will be displayed in the "The Result" field. 

### Dark Mode

To toggle dark mode, click the "Toggle Dark Mode" button at the top.
